# Web3-Token-Sniper

A bot written in Python to spot newly created trading pairs on blockchains' exchanges. Currently supported blockchains included Binance (pancakeswap), avalanche (traderjoexyz), ethereum (uniswap).

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a bot that can automatically spot a newly created trading pair on crypto exchanges and take action with it with buy or sell signals. Thorough out the process, I gain an in-depth understanding of the structure of defi exchanges and smart contracts. I utilize web3 to access on-chain data and employ Brownie to fork the current blockchain to identify potential honeypots.

### Functions:

* Spot newly created trading pairs (1 minute faster than most crypto listing websites)
* Reserve checking
* Honeypot detection
* Web-scrapping for testing purposes
